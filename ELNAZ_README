Folder contiki-2.7-- 

	It is designed to track the node behavior when node 1 is moved. 
	The collect-view is not working.
	
	It produces the text results in the rpl-dag.c and rpl_mrhof.c. Each time that any link's etx is changed, monitor_parents will print each parents status. If pref(ETX)<ETX_TH, then the potential preferred parent and probing algorihtm is activated. After one round of probing if pref(ETX) is still less than ETX_TH, ETX_TH will get updated. 




Features:
------------
	parents_monitor
	potential prents
	probing
	Adjusting ETX_TH 
	Test Script to run the experiment for 1 hour and change node 1 location at t=20 min.
	

examples:
---------------
	
	rpl-collec-etx: move node 1 at t=30min and monitor-parents(). simulation time=70min
	rpl-collect-etx-script: log output of motes in different files
